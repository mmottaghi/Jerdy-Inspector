<!-- In this test a header tag comes first (e.g. <link>, <meta> , ...) followed by a body tag (e.g. <div>, <p>, <img> ...).
	The header tag implicitly brings the <head> tag with it and the other tag will be placed under <body>.
	Any other header tag that comes after the second tag will not be placed under <head> anymore.
